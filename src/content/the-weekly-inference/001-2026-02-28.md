## This Week

The Pentagon's threat to designate Anthropic a supply-chain risk—alongside OpenAI raising $110 billion at an $840 billion valuation while burning through nearly identical amounts—exposes a fundamental tension: AI labs have grown so large that governments treat them as strategic infrastructure, yet they remain cash-incinerating startups whose business models depend on expensiveAPI access that competitors are now systematically stealing. Meanwhile, enterprises like Accenture mandate AI usage for promotions even as Amazon's own coding assistant takes down AWS, revealing that adoption is outpacing both the economic sustainability and operational maturity needed to support it. The question is no longer whether AI is transformative, but whether anyone—governments, investors, or the companies themselves—actually controls where this is heading.
