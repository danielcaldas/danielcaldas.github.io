The normal human spends a significant amount of their time going through chores like:
- 0.6h a day doing meal prep.
- 0.3h a day doing home interior cleaning.
- 0.1h a day doing laundry & clothing care.
- 0.06h a day doing home repairs and maintenance.
- For those who are parents it can be a 24/7 task when help is not available, let's discard that given that you can find meaning in it.
- For those who have pets it can be time consuming as well, let's discard that as well given that you can find meaning in it.

There are so many other chores that I could mention.

Summing up, humans spend 1h of every day of their lives doing something
meaningless but that needs to be done. **That's 7h a week**.

**The average human life expectancy is 70 years**, therefore **the average human spends 2.9 years of their life doing something meaningless but that needs to be done**.

That's 2.9 years of your life that you will never get back.
That's 2.9 years of your life that you could have spent doing something
meaningful, like learning a new skill, spending time with your family, or just relaxing.
That's 2.9 years of your life that you could have spent doing something
that you actually enjoy.
That's 2.9 years of your life that you could have spent doing something
that you actually care about.
That's 2.9 years of your life that you could have spent doing something
that you actually love.
That's 2.9 years of your life that you could have spent doing something
that you actually want to do.
